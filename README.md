custom_responsive
=================
This is a custom HTML5 boilerplate I created from scratch. I am treating this as a sandbox mainly for css but will be adding whatever comes to mind. Currently, it just has some standard css stuff.

However, it does include a custom smooth toggle sliding menu and a basic custom grid system. I also integrated a google map embed and audio player. More tweaks and fun stuff to come like building up SASS properties/base/layout OOCSS structure. I am doing that on other projects, jsut need ot find moment to implement it here.
